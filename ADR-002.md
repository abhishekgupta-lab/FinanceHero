# ADR-002: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Finance

## Context
FinanceHero aims to personalize the user experience by analyzing financial data and providing tailored recommendations. This ADR outlines the approach to leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for this purpose.

## Decision
We will integrate ML and AI models to power the Personal Finance Assistant (PFA) and offer personalized financial insights. This include:

- **Specialized Learning Models**: Utilizes supervised learning models for:
    - Expenses categorization to automatically categorize transactions.
    - Transaction prediction to forecast future income and expenses.
    - Goal setting to suggest achievable financial goals based on user data.
- **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**: Implement NLP to:
    - Understand user queries in natural language for interation with PFA.
    - Generate coversational responses from the PFA for a more engaging experience.

## Rationale
ML and AI offers:
- **Personalized Insights**: Analyze user data to provide recommendations on spending habits, budgeting strategies, and investiment opportunities
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Predict future financial trends to help users make informed decisions.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Enable natural language interaction through PFA, making financial management more accessible.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Personalized recommendations, improved financial literacy, increased user engagement.
- **Negative**: Requires ongoing investment in data science expertise and model development. Potential for biases in model output if training data is skewed.

## Status
Accepted
