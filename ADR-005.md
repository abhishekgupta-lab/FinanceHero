# ADR-005: Scalable and Cloud-based Infrastructure

## Context
FinanceHero needs to handle a growing user base and vast amounts of data. This ADR outlines the approach to ensure a scalable and reliable infrastructure.

## Decision
We will leverage a scalable cloud-based infrastructure to accommodate user growth and data storage demands. This includes:

- **Cloud Platform**:Utilize a reputable cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and flexibility.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Implement a microservices architecture to allow for independent development, deployment, and scaling of functionalities.
-**Auto-Scaling**: Employ auto-scaling capabilities to handle fluctuations in user traffic and optimize resource utilization.

## Rationale
A cloud-based infrastructure offers:
- **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale resources (storage, compute) to meet user demands.
- **Elasticity**: Pay only for the resources used, maximizing cost-efficiency.
- **Reliability**: Cloud platforms provide high availability and disaster recovery mechanisms.

Microservices architecture enables:

- **Modularity**: Independent development and deployment of feature simplifies update and maintenance.
- **Flexibility**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on usage and patterns.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
- **Negative**: Reliance on third-party cloud provider introduces vendor lock-in and potential security concerns.

## Status
Accepted
