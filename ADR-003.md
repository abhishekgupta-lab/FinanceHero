# ADR-003: Cloud-Based Receipt Storage with Security Considerations

## Context
FinanceHero aims to offer a receipt tracking feature where users can store receipts securely. This ADR explores leveraging existing cloud storage platforms (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) for receipt storage while considering security implications.

## Decision
We will not directly store receipts within the FinanceHero application. Instead, we will integrate with existing cloud storage platforms to allow users to:

- **Link Cloud Storage Accounts**: Users can securely connect their preferred cloud storage provider (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) to FinanceHero.
- **Upload Receipts**: Users can upload receipt images or PDFs directly from their devices or linked cloud storage accounts.
- **Access and Manage Receipts**: FinanceHero will provide functionalities to view, search, and organize receipts stored within the linked cloud storage platform.

## Rationale
Leveraging existing cloud storage offers several advantages:
- **Security**: Cloud storage providers typically employ robust security measures like encryption and access controls,mitigating the risk of data breaches within the FinanceHero app itself.
- **User Choice and Familiarity**: Users can choose their preferred cloud storage platform, leveraging existing security settings and access controls they're already familiar with.
-- **Reduced Storage Burden**: FinanceHero avoids the burden of managing user data storage and associated costs.

## Security Considerations
While leveraging cloud storage offers benefits, security concerns need to be addressed:

- **User Responsibility**: Users are responsible for maintaining storage security practices within their chosen cloud storage platform(e.g., enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords).
- **Data Access**: FinanceHero will only access receipt metadata (filenames, timestamps) for organization purposes, not the actual receipt content.
- **Data Visibility**: Users should be aware that cloud storage providers may have access to stored data depending on their terms of service.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Leverages existing security infrastructure of cloud storage providers, reduces storage burden for FinanceHero, and offers user choice.
- **Negative**: Relies on user practices for cloud storage security, limited control over actual receipt content storage by FinanceHero.

## Status
Proposed

## Next Steps
- Conduct a security risk assessment of this approach, considering user data privacy and potential access by cloud storage providers.
- Explore potential API integrations with specific cloud storage platforms for seamless user experience.
- Develop clear communication to users regarding data storage practices and security considerations.
