# [ADR-001: Data Security and Privacy]

## Context
FinanceHero, as a responsible aggregator of sensitive financial data, and is committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring data security. This ADR outlines our approach to safeguarding user information.

## Decision
To protect the user data, we will be implementing the following measures:
- **Encryption**: Using industry standard protocols like AES-256, all data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Authentication**: Implement robust user authentication protocols like OAuth-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure logins.
- **Security Audits**: Penetration testing and regular security audits will be conducted periodically to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data privacy regulations like CCPA or CPRA to protect user data.

## Rationale
User trust is crucial for FinanceHero's success. Robust security measures:
- **Enhance trust**: User confidence is built by prioritizing data security.
- **Minimize risks**: Encryption safeguards data from unauthorized access in case of breaches.
- **Avoid compliance issues**: Adherence to regulations prevents fines and reputational damage.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: User trust increases, regulatory compliance is achieved, and data breaches are mitigated.
- **Negative**: Implementing and maintaining security measures requires ongoing investment.


## Status
Accepted
